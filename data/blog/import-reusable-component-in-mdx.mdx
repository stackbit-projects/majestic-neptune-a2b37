## Testimonials Component in blog

We will use Testimonials component we used in the home page to show how we can use any custom component in blog using mdx file.

## Code to Implement

### file _app.js

```
import Testimonials from "../components/Testimonials";
...

<MDXProvider components={{ Image, Testimonials }}>
...
```


Once you have imported that component in the ```pages/_app.js``` file we can use it on mdx file. 

### file import-reusable-component-in-mdx.mdx 
```
<Testimonials />
```

Below is the output of the above code. 


<Testimonials />
