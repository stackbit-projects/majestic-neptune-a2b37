To start with Next.js you need to have node.js installed in your machine and that’s all. Next.js is like any other node.js application — you need npm or Yarn to install dependencies.First we have to create Next.js App and let's give it name as next-vital.

You can easily write a single command and Next.js project will be created.

```bash
npx create-next-app next-vital
```

After the installation is complete, follow the instructions to start the development server. Try editing pages/index.js and see the result on your browser.

To start developing your application run `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`. This starts the development server on `http://localhost:3000`.

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to view your application.

## Use of next/link

As we are using React Router in the react app for moving to one page to another page. Next.js have inbuilt component for routing as next/link.
